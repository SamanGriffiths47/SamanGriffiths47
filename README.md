<h1> 🎊✨Welcome, I'm Sam'an✨🎊 </h1>
  
  <p align=justify>I since junior highschool, I've been `driven` to be excellent at what I do. In my whole highschool career I only had 3 classes that weren't either AP or Honors. Since then I've carried that spirit into the restaurant industry (where I earned my first management position at just 19 years old), and now I'm bringing it to the world of software engineering and developement. I've created the passion projects you will find on my profile to display not only my skill, but my growth and determination. I emplore you, look around, dive into the code, follow a couple of the getting started sections. You will find that each project I've deployed is more refined than the last. Follow me on this path of growth towards excellence!</p>
